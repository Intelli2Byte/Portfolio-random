Space-Inspired Front-End Portfolio
A responsive single-page portfolio built with semantic HTML5 and CSS Grid.

The clean navigation bar anchors three core sections—Portfolio, Skills, and 
Contact—while a hero banner introduces Neha as a Space Enthusiast & JavaScript Developer. Project thumbnails and skill icons echo the cosmic theme with playful planet and comet illustrations. A lightweight contact form invites collaboration, and 
a minimalist footer rounds things off with social links and copyright.
Optimized for all viewports, the layout pairs bold typography with imagery to create a modern, engaging showcase for web-dev work.”
